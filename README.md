# Forecasting the Feb. 4, 2023 Duke vs. UNC game using cbbdata
### Dom Fenoglio - Assistant Blue Zone Editor, Duke Chronicle
Here, I take a look at past data on past Duke/UNC games to try to see who will win this year. All data used is from the cbbdata repository on github. Mainly, I try to use Torvik's formula to predict the outcome of the game. While this model was effective in predicting Duke and North Carolina's ACC games over the past few years, it was not nearly as effective in predicting the Rivalry game. Read my analysis of these results on dukechronicle.com. 

I have included my quarto markdown document and a pdf, so feel free to clone this repository and reproduce my results!
